# Huffman Compression Algorithm

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the Huffman Compression Algorithm for ASCII text files.

It was inspired by [this assignment](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cit5940/current/assignments/hw03/) from a data structures and algorithms course.

## Testing

JUnit tests are implemented with files `*Test.java`. These tests use JUnit v5.

They can probably be adapted for JUnit v4, with a little tweaking of the `import` statements.

The text of the `long-original.test.txt` was generated with [lipsum.com](https://www.lipsum.com/).
